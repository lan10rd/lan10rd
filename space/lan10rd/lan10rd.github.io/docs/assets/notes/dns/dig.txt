How to get all DNS records?

The short answer is to your specific question of listing CNAMEs is that you can't without permission to do zone transfers (see How to list all CNAME records for a given domain?).

That said, you can use dig to list the other records by doing:

dig +nocmd yourdomain.example any +multiline +noall +answer

dig google.com ANY

This may or may not work. Many DNS servers will deny a DNS Zone Transfer like this. For more information, see How the AXFR protocol works

dig -tAXFR mycompany.example


You can also use host DNS lookup utility with -l switch:

host -l example.com

Of course you need DNS zone transfer rights for this to work.
