-- for a nrwl monorepo lib to be publishable (and buildable, something else but might as well)
nx g @nrwl/nest:lib common/ns --buildable --publishable --importPath=@lanl0rdjs/common-ns
nx g @nrwl/angular:lib common/ng --publishable --buildable --importPath=@lanl0rdjs/common-ng

(--buildable is for pre built stuff, publishable is to make it npm ready, at which point you can do npm build libname, then cd dist/libname and npm publish)

--- then run these commands --

nx build lib-name
cd dist/libs/lib-name
npm login // (if you havent already)
npm publish --scope=@lanl0rdjs --access public

* seems like package.json is all thats necessary mainly, i like to bump the versions then build then publish (from dist which puts a little package.json in there)
