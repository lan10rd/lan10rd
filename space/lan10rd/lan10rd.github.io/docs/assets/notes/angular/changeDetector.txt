this.cd.detectChanges() /* supposed to use to broadcast change to children, only works once with custom change detector, ChangeDetectoryStrategy.OnPush seems to make the component detatched */
this.cd.markForCheck() /* supposed to use to broadcast change to parents */


@Component
({
    selector: 'common-select-element', 
    templateUrl: './select.element.ng.html',
    styleUrls: ['./select.element.ng.scss'],
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush /* prevents cd.detectChanges() from working more than once :/ */
})



ran into nasty error about after view checked

<common-select-element
            [options]="json.keys(srv._magic.stacks.json.services)"
            [(target)]="targetService"
            (targetChange)="cd.detectChanges()"
            ></common-select-element>


was using common select element that had custom change detection, finally fixed by adding change detector ref to parent and running detect changes on event.... i think it's supposed to be fixed by using markForCheck in the child, but couldnt get it to work :/
