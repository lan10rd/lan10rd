what happens if the browser does not support `loading="lazy"`? If it does not cause any bug, we can just put it there always. We won't need a directive

I think you meant to say lazy here.

Great read. I should try this out. For now, I used the ng-lazyload-image library to accomplish the same thing.
Can you compare this one with your implementation and give me benefits of doing this yourself?

Mine is an image intensive app.
Full page load time reduced from 2.4 sec to 1.4 sec after adding this trick.

and loading.
I guess you had mean `lazy`, not `loading`

There is a tiny misleading error. There should be ‚Äòlazy‚Äô not ‚Äòloading‚Äô for one of the loading attribute values.

Lazy Load Images in Angular with Two Lines of Code

Image for post
Image lazy loading defers the loading of an image that isn‚Äôt currently visible in the viewport. Such an image will be loaded only when the user scrolls and the image becomes visible. Using this technique, we can gain better performance and load time.
Today modern browsers added native support for lazy loading images, and we can benefit from it by adding one simple attribute to our img element:

The loading attribute supports three options ‚Äî auto, eager, and lazy. Setting it to lazy will defer the loading of the resource until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.

Browser support
Let‚Äôs create a directive that seamlessly adds this attribute if the browser supports it:

We check if the browser supports this feature. If that‚Äôs the case, we add the loading attribute; Otherwise, we leave the default behavior.

We can also take it one step further and fallback to an IntersectionObserver implementation, which is supported by all browsers (except IE).
