stack files are used to help group the deployment of several services together, similar to compose you can use a yaml format

bb-stack.yaml:

version: '3.7'

services:
  bb-app:
    image: bulletinboard:1.0
    ports:
      - "8000:8080"

1. Deploy your application to Swarm:

    docker stack deploy -c bb-stack.yaml demo

If all goes well, Swarm will report creating all your stack objects with no complaints:

Creating network demo_default
Creating service demo_bb-app
Notice that in addition to your service, Swarm also creates a Docker network by default to isolate the containers deployed as part of your stack.

docker stack rm demo



remove all stacks:

docker stack rm $(docker stack ls -q)
