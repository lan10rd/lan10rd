To set this environment variable, first determine where Java is installed. Use the update-alternatives command:

sudo update-alternatives --config java
 
This command shows each installation of Java along with its installation path:

Output
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1111      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1111      manual mode
* 2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-oracle/bin/java             1091      manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:
In this case the installation paths are as follows:
/etc/environment


OpenJDK 11 is located at /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java.
Oracle Java is located at /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-oracle/jre/bin/java.
Copy the path from your preferred installation. Then open /etc/environment using nano or your favorite text editor:

sudo nano /etc/environment
 
At the end of this file, add the following line, making sure to replace the highlighted path with your own copied path, but do not include the /bin portion of the path:

/etc/environment
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64"
 
Modifying this file will set the JAVA_HOME path for all users on your system.

Save the file and exit the editor.

Now reload this file to apply the changes to your current session:

source /etc/environment
 
Verify that the environment variable is set:

echo $JAVA_HOME
 
Youâ€™ll see the path you just set:

Output
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
