// had a disk, raoyi decay or something

sudo zfs unmount -f raoyi // wasnt destroying without unmounting
sudo zfs destroy raoyi
sudo zpool create -m /zfspools/raoyi raoyi /dev/disk/by-id/ata-123

sudo zpool import -f raoyi

if on mac, the /zfspools mountpoint isnt available, and you must use -R option for alternate root

sudo zpool import -f -R /Volumes raoyi

this will actually mount the device at  /Volumes/zfspools/raoyi  

typically apple zpools are on /Volumes like /Volumes/blue


also you can just type "zpool import" and it will list all the possibly importable devices! to change name on import just add the new pool name after like
zpool import -f blue red


if you have conflicting names i think you can use the device id, which you can see with zpool import
