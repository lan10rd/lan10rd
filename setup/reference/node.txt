if you are in a folder and want to do some scripting with ts-node, youll usually need to create a package.json so that you can import some libraries. 

npm init

just walk through the prompt, might be able to add options to do it quicker.

might also be able to import certain libraries globally

to start scripting with ts-node, do something like this to make a system call in bash

const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('sudo apt-get update', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
  // your callback
});


to make http call simple library node-fetch


import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/github');
const data = await response.json();

console.log(data);
