üîé **Smart, Fast and Extensible Build System**

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@grams/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

### removed dependencies, looks like angular builder needed this but the version that was brought in was complaining about es import syntax or something
ora 
## removed because of unsafe
colors

## libs 
nx g @nrwl/angular:lib common/ng/core --buildable --publishable --importPath=@grams/common/ng/core

## app config and generator commands ran
nx g @nrwl/angular:app reference-app-ng
nx g @nrwl/nest:app reference-api-ns

nx g @nrwl/angular:app docs-app-ng

nx g @scullyio/init:install -- --project=docs-app-ng


### learning and notes
for angular apps i noticed that if your goal is to keep main.js as small as possible (usually is), despite only loading and importing dynamic element (from common/ng) into app module, and putting everything else in init element so that it can bootstrap the heavier elements, it actually bloats main.js to the size of the metadata of the common/ng library (which grows as you add to index.ts, even if you dont use any other element/components!!)

so... made a second library, common/ng/core, which basically just includes dynamic element, thats the import that should be in app module and finally the total main.js bundle is back to 30kb!.. well under 500 now, and doesnt grow! the only way it will grow is adding more to app module or to app init service


### serving

nx serve reference-app-ng --host 0.0.0.0 --disableHostCheck
