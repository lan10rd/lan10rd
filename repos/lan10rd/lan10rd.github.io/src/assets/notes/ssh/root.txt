to start you need to be able to ssh into your own user on localhost:
1. ssh-keygen -t rsa
Press enter for each line 
2. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
3. chmod og-wx ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 


first you have to enable root user (ubuntu desktop i believe starts this off by default)
sudo passwd root
enter password:
reenter password:

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin yes
systemctl restart sshd    or    service sshd restart

// PermitRootLogin without-password // this didnt worky work!


so once you do that you can:

cp -R /home/$USER/.ssh /root/.ssh

now you should be able to ssh root@localhost ! yay!
