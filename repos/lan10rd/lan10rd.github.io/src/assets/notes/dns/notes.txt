This method works on the Ubuntu releases 17.04 (Zesty), 17.10 (Artful), 18.04 (Bionic), 18.10 (Cosmic), 19.04 (Disco) and 20.04 (Focal):

Disable and stop the systemd-resolved service:

sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
Then put the following line in the [main] section of your /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:

dns=default
Delete the symlink /etc/resolv.conf

rm /etc/resolv.conf
Restart NetworkManager

sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
Also be aware that disabling systemd-resolvd might break name resolution in VPN for some users. See this bug on launchpad (Thanks, Vincent).
