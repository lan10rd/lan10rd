Properties that control alignment
The properties we will look at in this guide are as follows.

justify-content — controls alignment of all items on the main axis.
align-items — controls alignment of all items on the cross axis.
align-self — controls alignment of an individual flex item on the cross axis.
align-content — described in the spec as for “packing flex lines”; controls space between flex lines on the cross axis.
gap, column-gap, and row-gap — used to create gaps or gutters between flex items.
We will also discover how auto margins can be used for alignment in flexbox.

We can use other values to control how the items align:

align-items: flex-start
align-items: flex-end
align-items: center
align-items: stretch
align-items: baseline
