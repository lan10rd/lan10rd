CS:GO FOV and Viewmodel Commands
This category contains all commands that can be used to modify your camera's field of view (FOV), and also commands that change your view model (the location of your gun/character's hands).

Best Viewmodel Settings
The best viewmodel settings vary from person to person, but the general consensus is that the more "out of the way" your viewmodel is the better. This is because the viewmodel will obstruct your view less, allowing for better visibility.

To set optimal, most out-of-the-way, viewmodel settings, copy and paste the below command into your developer console:

viewmodel_offset_x 2.5; viewmodel_offset_y -2; viewmodel_offset_z -2; viewmodel_fov 54 

We have outlined what each of these commands does below.

How to Change Viewmodel
Your viewmodel is your character's hands, the gun that you're holding, and anything else fixed in-front of the camera when in first-person mode. There are four commands commands that change the position of your viewmodel, they are outlined in the table below:

Name	Min/Max	Description	Best Setting
viewmodel_offset_x	-2.5 to 2.5	Changes how far right or left your gun is	viewmodel_offset_x 2.5 
viewmodel_offset_y	-2 to 2	Changes how close your gun is to your character	viewmodel_offset_y -2 
viewmodel_offset_z	-2 to 2	Changes how far up or down your gun is	viewmodel_offset_z -2 
viewmodel_fov	54 to 68	Changes the field of view of your viewmodel	viewmodel_fov 54 
To change your field of view to something other than our recommended settings outlined above, simply replace the number at the end of the command with a number between the command's "Min/Max" from the table.

How to Move Viewmodel to Left or Right (cl_righthand)
By default, your gun is on the right hand side of your screen in CS:GO. For some players, especially those that are left handed, this may not be preferable. You can move the gun to the left hand side of your screen with the following command:

cl_righthand 0 

To move your gun to the right hand side of your screen, use the following console command:

cl_righthand 1 

How to Change Your Field of View (FOV) with Commands
There are two types of field of view: your viewmodel's FOV, which changes the position of your viewmodel (your hands and gun in first person mode) and your camera's FOV, which changes how zoomed in and out your camera is. Only your viewmodel's FOV can be changed in servers without cheats (matchmaking, etc). To change your camera's FOV, you need to be in a server with sv_cheats 1.

How to Change Viewmodel FOV
Your viewmodel's field of view in CS:GO can be set to a value between 54 and 68. To set it to 68, its maximum value, type the following command into the developer console:

viewmodel_fov 68 

To set your viewmodel's field of view to 54, which is its lowest possible value, use the following command:

viewmodel_fov 54 

Change 54 or 68 to your desired FOV (must be between 54 and 68), it might take some playing around with to get your most preferable field of view.

How to Change Camera FOV (sv_cheats)
Changing the field of view your camera has can only be done on a server with sv_cheats enabled. You can enable sv_cheats by typing the following command into the console:

sv_cheats 1 

After enabling sv_cheats, you can change your field of view by replacing NUMBER in the below command with the FOV you wish to set (default is 90):

fov_cs_debug NUMBER 

Since the default FOV for CS:GO is 90, the below command would make your field of view larger by setting it to 120 (meaning you can see more in your camera):

fov_cs_debug 120 

And this command would make your FOV smaller by setting it to 50 (meaning you'd be able to see less than usually:

fov_cs_debug 50

The most useful console commands for CS:GO
Make the most of your console.

You’re missing out if you’re not using console commands in Counter-Strike. The tactical shooter features a long list of options to personalize your game, dwarfing its competitors.

You can use the console to add, tweak, and replace elements of the game’s user interface, including your mini-map, HUD, crosshair, and much more. 

To use the console, press the tilde (`) key on your keyboard when you’re in a game. If you haven’t already, you can enable your console by heading to your settings and checking the “enable developer console” box.

When you open the console, type in any one of these commands.

net_graph 1
This command allows you to see a ton of useful information on your screen, including FPS, ping, and tick rate. 

fps_max 0
This command helps you maximize your frames per second (FPS). It takes away the restriction on your FPS and allows your PC to reach its maximum potential. Instead of being stuck behind the barrier of 60 FPS, you can go above and beyond.

cl_radar_always_centered
The radar is often misleading. When a red dot shows up on the edge of the map, it can put you into a false sense of security. This commend centers the radar, allowing you to see all over the map. It might take some time to get used to, but it’s well worth the effort. 

cl_use_opens_buy_menu 0
Have you ever gone to pick up a weapon off the ground in spawn and accidentally opened up your buy menu? This helpful command will prevent your “use” key (default E) from opening up the buy menu.

+cl_show_team_equipment
This command allows you to see your teammate’s weapons and utility loadout above their heads, giving you a bigger picture of the game. It can be used to single out a teammate and gather information about smokes or flashbangs. 

voice_scale 0.3
This command will help you counteract your noisy teammates that enjoy screaming rather than playing. It lowers the volume of your teammates to a suitable level, allowing you to focus on the game.

novid
This command turns off Valve’s annoying pre-game intros, saving you a few seconds when you load up a new map.

language
This command switches your client to another language. If you speak French, for example, type language [french] in the console. 

bot_add
This command will add a bot into your private game, allowing you to practice your aim before you jump into matchmaking.

cl_hud_color
You can personalize your HUD with this command. Write cl_hud_color [HUD Color] and choose a color. Green, Cyan, Red, and Blue are just a few available options.

cl_lefthand
If you’re a lefty or you want a change of pace, this command will allow you to move your gun to the left side of your screen. If you want to change it back to default, type cl_righthand.

sv_cheats 1
This command will give you the ability to experiment with your own personal server. You can use it to activate almost any client-sided or server-sided console command you please.  

sv_grenade_trajectory 1 and sv_grenade_trajectory_time 10
This command is excellent for practicing grenades. You can use it to execute pop-flashes, smokes, and get to grips with the game’s physics.

cl_drawonlydeathnotices 1
For the frag movie makers out there, this command turns off the heads-up display (HUD) and replaces them with your victims’ aliases in your clips.

r_drawtracers_firstperson 0
This command turns off the client-side bullet tracers from weapons like the M4A4 and the AK-47. It’s useful for improving your spray control and practicing your favorite guns. 

spec_show_xray 1
You can use this command while watching demos. It shows player models movements through walls, allowing you to pick up on player behaviorisms. It’s especially useful for catching out wallhackers in Valve’s Overwatch system.

cl_show_team_equipment
This command lets you view your teammate’s utility. Instead of asking them if they have a couple of flashbangs and a smoke at hand, you can simply look at your screen. 

voice_enable 0
If you’re sick and tired of listening to your teammates rambling on about nonsense, this command will give you some peace and quiet. It mutes all of the players on your team.

net_graph
This command will enable (set to 1) and disable (set to 0) a table on your screen, showing your ping, FPS, and other useful information.

cl_showfps
This command adds a simple frames per sound count in the top left corner of your screen. It takes up much less room than net_graph and is generally less distracting.

demoui
This command brings up a small rectangular interface for watching demos. It’s helpful for speeding up viewing, slowing down highlights, and manually loading demo files from third-party server hosts like FACEIT or ESEA.

god
This command gives you “god mode,” making you indestructible in private servers. It requires the sv_cheats 1 command.

noclip
If you’ve ever fancied flying around the map, noclip is the command for you. It requires the sv_cheats 1 command and only works in private servers.

kill
This command kills you on the spot.

exec
Exec is great for enabling private server configurations (.cfg files for practice, one-on-ones, etc.) that you can create or download from third-party websites.

disconnect
This command allows you to immediately leave a server, saving you a few extra clicks. It’s particularly useful at the end of a match.

quit
This command closes CS:GO, taking you back to the desktop.
