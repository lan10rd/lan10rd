I turned ssl to Full (strict) to eliminate the redirects problem i was having..

could maybe do off?

it seems this is because cloudflare sits in between?


anyway the rest of the records are straightforward..

in namecheap put the 2 nameservers cloudflare tells to do.

from there youre managing your records in cloudflare

*  x.x.x.x
@  x.x.x.x


any mx records etc
