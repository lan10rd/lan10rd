sooo this is kinda dangerous but lets say you do a few things you want to rollback on your branch.

pull in your branch, lets assume its "main" and make sure there is not changes with git status
assuming the commit you want to go back to is 557689b221a2c8c3355403ebc00e4e2bd24b5fc0  
git status should show you are "behind"
-----
git reset -hard 557689b221a2c8c3355403ebc00e4e2bd24b5fc0  
git status
git push --force origin main
