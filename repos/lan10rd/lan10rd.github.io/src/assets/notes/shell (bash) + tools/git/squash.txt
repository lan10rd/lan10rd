---- if you already have multiple commits ---
git rebase -i

--- replace all but the most recent (top) with squash ---

git commit --amend

---- if you need to have all your changes in one commit for pipeline reasons, --
git commit -m "first"
git commit -am "second, but replaces the last commit essentially so that you can continue to work"
git commit -am ""
