docker save angular | gzip > angular.tar.gz
docker load < angular.tar.gz


Transferring a Docker image via SSH, bzipping the content on the fly:

docker save <image> | bzip2 | ssh user@host docker load
Note that docker load automatically decompresses images for you. It supports gzip, bzip2 and xz.

It's also a good idea to put pv in the middle of the pipe to see how the transfer is going:

docker save <image> | bzip2 | pv | ssh user@host docker load

More info about pv: home page, man page).

Important note from @Thomas Steinbach: on high bandwidth, bzip won't be able to compress fast enough. In case you can upload at 10 MB/s and more, gzip/gunzip will be much faster than bzip2.

If you're on 3G and your Internet is slow, @jgmjgm suggests that you can use xz: it offers a higher compression ratio.
