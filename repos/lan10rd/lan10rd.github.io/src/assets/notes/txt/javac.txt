if you want to use a jar manually, you need to add to the system's classpath.

for instance with the standard libraries need in the princeton lessons,

export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/earth/realms/glass/src/static/lessons/java/algorithms/algs4.jar

then classes exported will be available to others in the same package (without explicitly importing).

package edu.princeton.cs.algs4;


orrrrr

Using Java 6 or later, the classpath option supports wildcards. Note the following:

Use straight quotes (")
Use *, not *.jar
Windows

java -cp "Test.jar;lib/*" my.package.MainClass

Unix

java -cp "Test.jar:lib/*" my.package.MainClass


orrrrr

javac -cp ...

Specifies where to find user class files, and (optionally) annotation processors and source files. This class path overrides the user class path in the CLASSPATH environment variable. If neither CLASSPATH, -cp nor -classpath is specified, then the user class path is the current directory. See Setting the Class Path.

If the -sourcepath option is not specified, then the user class path is also searched for source files.

If the -processorpath option is not specified, then the class path is also searched for annotation processors.

javac -cp /Users/user/documents/algorithms/algs4-master/target/algs4-1.0.0.0.jar edu.princeton.cs.algs4.BinarySearch
