so to for an event (endpoint) you can response with an observable or synchronously with {event: 'eventName', data: {}} and a message will be sent to connected sockets, if you just wish to respond back to the original socket who emitted the event, just response with the data {} you wish and an "acknowledgement" will be sent (for this to work, the client just needs to add an optional 4th parameter, which is a callback function)

examples:
1) normal


2) with acknowledgement
