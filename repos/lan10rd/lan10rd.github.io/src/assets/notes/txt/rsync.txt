---- options ----
-a is for archive, which preserves ownership, permissions etc.
-h is for human-readable, so the transfer rate and file sizes are easier to read (optional)
-W is for copying whole files only, without delta-xfer algorithm which should reduce CPU load
-u is for preserving modified files on the destination
-P resume files that were interrupted in a cp or something
--max-size='500K' for setting a limit on file size
--progress so I can see the progress of large files (optional)

-v, –verbose                             Verbose output

-b, –backup                              take the backup during synchronization

-i see differenced: indicates change in destination file, f: indicates a file, t: indicates change in timestamps, s: indicates change in size
 --dry-run ??
 --bwlimit=600  set a bandwidth limit in kb/s
