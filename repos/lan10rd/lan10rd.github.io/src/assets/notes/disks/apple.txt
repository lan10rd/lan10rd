diskutil list


sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/dev/disk3

status=progress bs=8192

# if you see that a disk in use its probably 3 and you can just unmount the partitions of the busy disk with
sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk3s1



so you cant do status=progress after dd command, but you can do ctl + t and get some info!
