According to the comments, on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS this seems to be the solution:

systemctl enable mongodb.service
Thanks to @Adam. I had the same "problem" on Debian jessie, and my solution there was:

systemctl enable mongod.service
Maybe they changed the name of the service. I think in Ubuntu it's the same.

startup:

# You can optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot by issuing the following command:

sudo systemctl enable mongod


start:
sudo systemctl start mongod

# If you receive an error similar to the following when starting mongod: (for first time)
# Failed to start mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not found.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

status:

sudo systemctl status mongod

stop:

sudo systemctl stop mongod

restart:

sudo systemctl restart mongod
