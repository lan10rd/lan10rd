git config --global credential.helper manager
git config --global credential.helper wincred


/* on the next pull it should prompt for password */

sometimes if its being a royal pain like first time setup, search for credentials manager in windows search, then click on windows credentials, then add a new generic credential like:

git:https://itec-stash.somedomain.com
username
pass


/* also this may help to do first but i think ultimately on windows its the credentials manager */

git config --global user.name "Lastname, Firstname"
git config --global user.email "companyemail@domain.com"
