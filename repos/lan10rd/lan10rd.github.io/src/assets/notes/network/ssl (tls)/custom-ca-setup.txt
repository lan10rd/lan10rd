For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Now that you have a CA, you can create a server key and certificate signing request (CSR). Make sure that “Common Name” matches the hostname you use to connect to Docker:

Note: Replace all instances of $HOST in the following example with the DNS name of your Docker daemon’s host.

Next, we’re going to sign the public key with our CA:

Since TLS connections can be made through IP address as well as DNS name, the IP addresses need to be specified when creating the certificate. For example, to allow connections using 10.10.10.20 and 127.0.0.1:

/*
o make the key suitable for client authentication, create a new extensions config file:
*/

echo extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth > extfile-client.cnf

/* Now, generate the signed certificate: */

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha256 -in client.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem \
  -CAcreateserial -out cert.pem -extfile extfile-client.cnf

/*
Signature ok
subject=/CN=client

Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:

/*
After generating cert.pem and server-cert.pem you can safely remove the two certificate signing requests and extensions config files:
*/

rm -v client.csr server.csr extfile.cnf extfile-client.cnf

/*
With a default umask of 022, your secret keys are world-readable and writable for you and your group.

To protect your keys from accidental damage, remove their write permissions. To make them only readable by you, change file modes as follows:
*/

chmod -v 0400 ca-key.pem key.pem server-key.pem

/*
Certificates can be world-readable, but you might want to remove write access to prevent accidental damage:
*/

chmod -v 0444 ca.pem server-cert.pem cert.pem

/*
Now you can make the Docker daemon only accept connections from clients providing a certificate trusted by your CA:

dockerd --tlsverify --tlscacert=ca.pem --tlscert=server-cert.pem --tlskey=server-key.pem \
