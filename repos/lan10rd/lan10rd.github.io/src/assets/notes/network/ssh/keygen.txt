/* had a really rough time on of my boxes, it seems it was just the .ssh folder in /root , i just blew it away and cp -R /home/user/.ssh as that was working, and low and behold it started working... stay tuned gonna try from scratch i think authorized_keys is only supposed to have 600 permissions

chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 600 .ssh/*
