It looks like you somehow changed file ownerships in your home directory.

One way to correct this without endangering your system is


sudo chown -c -R $USER:$USER $HOME


Explanation:

chown: change the ownership of files/directories
-c: report all changes
-R: do this recursively (for all files/directories beneath the given one)
$USER:$USER: change the owner and the group that owns the the entry to the user that issues the command (sudo preserves the values)
$HOME: do this with your home directory
You can test those environment variables with the following commands

echo $USER
sudo echo $USER
echo $HOME
sudo echo $HOME
