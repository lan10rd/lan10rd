Install from a package
If you cannot use Dockerâ€™s repository to install Docker Engine, you can download the .deb file for your release and install it manually. You need to download a new file each time you want to upgrade Docker.

/* install manually */
/*
Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/, choose your Ubuntu version, then browse to pool/stable/, choose amd64, armhf, or arm64, and download the .deb file for the Docker Engine version you want to install.
Note: To install a nightly or test (pre-release) package, change the word stable in the above URL to nightly or test. Learn about nightly and test channels.
Install Docker Engine, changing the path below to the path where you downloaded the Docker package.
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb
