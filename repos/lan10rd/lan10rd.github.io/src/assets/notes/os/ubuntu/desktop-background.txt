Both Unity and Gnome Shell (Gnome 3) use GSettings now instead of GConf. So in Unity and Gnome Shell you can use the command-line tool gsettings for that. Like gconftool, it lets you get or set an individual key.

You can get the current URI of the background image as follows:

gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri
'file:///home/serrano/Pictures/x.jpg'
And set the background URI as follows (which will immediately update your desktop background):

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/serrano/Pictures/y.jpg
Notice that you must prepend the URI with "file://" for this to work (unlike with gconftool).

In order to make your script work with both Gnome 2 and Shell/Unity, you can let it do a Gnome version check first:

gnome-session --version
That will return the version of Gnome. If the version number starts with 3, then gsettings can be used. If it returns a version starting with 2, let your script use gconftool instead.
