// for start after user login add this line in /etc/gdm3/Init/Default right before exit 0... that didnt work, so actually just make a script somewhere, like lanl0rd/space/startup/x11.sh and then hit menu and type startup (startup applications), and add the x11.sh (make sure to chmod u+x x11.sh of course!)
/usr/bin/x11vnc -auth guess -forever -loop -noxdamage -repeat -rfbauth $HOME/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5901 -shared || true 


-nopwd  // no password i think, see if you can do this instead of rfbauth or just run without rfbauth and password 

actualy, just run with this!!!! no password on 5900 easy peeeasy (if you have video sharing enabled with vino (default gnome/ubuntu sharing method) turn it off so that x11vnc can have 5900, otherwise youll be stuck on 5901!)
