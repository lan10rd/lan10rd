sudo apt install -y linux-tools-generic


Server side setup
The server is the one that has the real USB device physically attached to it.

1. Load the USBPIP kernel driver:

sudo modprobe usbip_host

2. Start the USB/IP daemon:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbipd &

3. List all the devices connected:

/usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip list -l


In my case it lists:

$ /usr/lib/linux-tools/4.2.0-16-generic/usbip list -l
 - busid 1-10 (04f2:b446)
   Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd : unknown product (04f2:b446)

 - busid 1-2.2 (045e:071d)
   Microsoft Corp. : unknown product (045e:071d)

 - busid 1-2.4 (046d:c52b)
   Logitech, Inc. : Unifying Receiver (046d:c52b)

 - busid 1-3 (0458:706e)
   KYE Systems Corp. (Mouse Systems) : unknown product (0458:706e)

4. Select the device you want to share and bind it with the following command:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip bind -b <device ID>
In my case I want to share my Webcam which is the device with bus ID 1-3:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip bind -b <Device bus ID>
Now the device is ready to be accesed from a client computer!



Client side setup
Let's try to access our webcam from another computer on the same network.

1. Mount the VHCI driver:

sudo modprobe vhci-hcd
2. List all devices available from the server:

/usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip list -r <Server IP address>

In my case:

SERVER_IP=10.251.101.16
/usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip list -r $SERVER_IP
$ /usr/lib/linux-tools/4.4.0-83-generic/usbip list -r 10.251.101.16
Exportable USB devices
======================
 - 10.251.101.16
        1-3: KYE Systems Corp. (Mouse Systems) : unknown product (0458:706e)
           : /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-3
           : Miscellaneous Device / ? / Interface Association (ef/02/01)
3. Let's attach to the selected device:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip attach -r <server IP address> -b <Device bus ID>
In my case I only have one device:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip attach -r 10.251.101.16 -b 1-3
Now you should have your device exposed on your client computer as if it was connected to it. You can now simply use it as usual e.g:

gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! fakesink -v


Disconnect the devices
In order to disconnect the devices you must firt detach from your client:

1. List all devices attached:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip port
2. Detach the corresponding port:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip detach -p 00
Then we just unbind the device from our server:

3. Unbind device on server side:

sudo /usr/lib/linux-tools/$(uname -r)/usbip unbind -b 1-3
