-- for a nrwl monorepo lib to be publishable (and buildable, something else but might as well)
nx g @nrwl/nest:lib common/ns --buildable --publishable --importPath=@lanl0rdjs/common-ns
nx g @nrwl/angular:lib common/ng --publishable --buildable --importPath=@lanl0rdjs/common-ng

(--buildable is for pre built stuff, publishable is to make it npm ready, at which point you can do npm build libname, then cd dist/libname and npm publish)

--- then run these commands --

nx build lib-name
cd dist/libs/lib-name
npm login // (if you havent already)
npm publish --scope=@lanl0rdjs --access public

* seems like package.json is all thats necessary mainly, i like to bump the versions then build then publish (from dist which puts a little package.json in there)



--- sometimes when publishing on a new account you may see Not Found - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@lan10rdjs%2fcommon-ng - Scope not found


If you want to publish a package on npm using the name @npmtestscope/firstpackage, you need to make sure that the namespace @npmtestscope exists on npm. To create that namespace, you need to create an organization on npm with the name npmtestscope.

After you have created the organization, you can publish your package named @npmtestscope/firstpackage by executing npm publish --access public.

Note: To run npm publish for a package that belongs to a npm organization, you need to be logged in on your computer as a member of that organization. You can do that by executing npm login. The npm whoami command will show you the user name associated with the current login.
