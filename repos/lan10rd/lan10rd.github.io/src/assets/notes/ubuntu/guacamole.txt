apache guacamole rocks my socks, vnc/rdp/ssh to any computer on the network, just using docker + specific ozn/guac image cuase the guacamole ones require several.

so anyway you can do vnc or rdp, rdp is best easy for windows sound + audio out of the box, but you gotta put in the user name and pass in the configurations. you can leave pass blank if you configured windows not to need a password for remote connections


// rdp sample
name: seven
type: RDP

NETWORK
hostname: 192.168.0.14
port: 3389

AUTHENTICATION
user: simba
pass: 


// vnc sample
name: clear
type: VNC

NETWORK
hostname: 192.168.0.37
port: 5900

AUDIO 
enable: true
hostname: 192.168.0.37


**note** 
there is no port in audio, but it should run on 4713 if you allowed tcp server for pulse audio

// ubuntu rdp
still havent figured it out quite yet, i know you can do sudo install xrdp, and then you can rdp in but it freezes.. oh and i had to add 2 lines to even get it to do anything but a black screen,
nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
Add in the very top:

unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

sudo systemctl restart xrdp
