you are struggling and used to using  ng add, what you would do is take the dependency, @angular/pwa, lets say, and run   nx list @angular/pwa

which should print generator commands you can use, like pwa or ng-add.

so then basically instead of 

ng add @angular/pwa 


nx g @angular/pwa:pwa --project=play-app-ng
