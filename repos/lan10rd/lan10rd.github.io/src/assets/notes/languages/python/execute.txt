#!/usr/bin/python

chmod +x script.py

./script.py



There are two things you need to do:

Make sure the file is executable: chmod +x script.py
Use a shebang to let the kernel know what interpreter to use. The top line of the script should read:

#!/usr/bin/python
This assumes that your script will run with the default python. If you need a specific version, just specify in the shebang:

#!/usr/bin/python2.7
Now you can type:

    ./script.py
if the script is in your current directory, or:

    script.py
if the location of the script happens to be in your PATH, or:

    path/to/script.py
otherwise.

#!/usr/bin/env python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
Generally it's a better idea to use #!/usr/bin/env python, in case the user has a local build of python
