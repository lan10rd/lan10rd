du -h your_directory

If you want a brief output, du -hcs your_directory is nice.



The command starts with sudo because most of the files and directories inside the /var directory are owned by the root user and are not readable by the regular users. If you omit sudo the du command will print “du: cannot read directory”.
s - Display only the total size of the specified directory, do not display file size totals for subdirectories.
h - Print sizes in a human-readable format (h).
/var - The path to the directory you want to get the size.
What if you want to display the disk usage of the first-level subdirectories? You have two options. The first one is to use the asterisk symbol (*) as shown below, which means “match everything that doesn’t start with a period (.)”. The -c option tells du to print a grand total of all sizes:

sudo du -shc /var/*


du -shc /zfspools/gold/earth/*

3G gold/earth/media
