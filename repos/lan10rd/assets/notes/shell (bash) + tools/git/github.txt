in order to push now, you need a personal access token... not sure about other repos (it seems you can pin/star another users repo, then make changes, and pull request it back to the original author's repo).

login to github, go to developer settings, personal access tokens. create a new token (preferably that doesnt expire) and give it all the scopes (maybe not the delete one).

Personal Access Tokens (PAT) can only be used for HTTPS git operations. Switch your repository to HTTPS if it is using SSH.

https is the easy newb way, ssh keys can probably avoid all this.


---

now time to login or store the pat for pushes, not sure if its just one time when you do 

git push https://<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git

--- actually ---
just do git push, it will prompt for login, enter user name and for password use the PAT

not sure how to git login or out
