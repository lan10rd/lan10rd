Ubuntu â€“ How to delete multiple lines in nano without affecting the clipboard
nanoshortcut-keys

I can select all file by going to the 1st line Alt+\, start marking the text by Alt+A, go to the last line by Alt+/

But there, I don't know which key to remove the selected text. Hit delete doesn't work for me but Ctrl+K to cut the text will destroy my clipboard.

So, what is the hotkey to delete selected text?

nano of course can delete blocks, see this article

use CTRL+Shift+6 to mark the beginning of your block
move cursor with arrow keys to end of your block, the text will be highlighted.
use CTRL+K to cut/delete block.
To paste the block to another place, move cursor to the position and the use CTRL+U. You can paste the block as often as you want to.
