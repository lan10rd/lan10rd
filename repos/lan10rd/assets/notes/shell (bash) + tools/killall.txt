Kill any lingering ssh processes
Also ignoring "sshd" server is necessary since you should not kill ssh server processes.

ps aux | grep ssh | grep -v grep | grep -v sshd | awk {'print $2'} | xargs -r kill -9

What Others Think
Sweet, now my mysql backup script is complete bwahahaha! (I can make sure that pesky mysqld is really stopped before tarring /var/lib/mysql) init.d has failed me before) thanks!

You do not need a loop for that
ps aux | grep ssh | grep -v grep | awk {'print $2'} | kill -9
or better
ps aux | grep ssh | grep -v grep | awk {'print $2'} | xargs -r kill -9

If you do this while ssh'ed in, you'll probably kill your own session...

Well, you might use ps -A and check whether it is in your terminal (checking for pts/0, etc) and do it that way. But that works.
