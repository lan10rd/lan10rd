Traditionally, such scripts either go in ~/bin (ie: the bin directory in your home directory) or /usr/local/bin/ The former means the script will only work for you, the latter is for scripts you want anybody on the system to be able to run.

If you put it in ~/bin, you may need to add that to your PATH environment variable. /usr/local/bin should already be on the path.
