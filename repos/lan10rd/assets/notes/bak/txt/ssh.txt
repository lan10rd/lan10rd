ssh-keygen (make sure to enter through all of the prompts so there is no password and it's just a vanilla key! make sure to do this in ~/.ssh) <-- doesn't matter where

On Windows (powershell admin):
1) Start-Service ssh-agent (should already be automatically running!)
2) Get-Service ssh-agent (just to check!)
3) ssh-add ~\.ssh\id_rsa

On Apple (normal terminal):
1) ssh-keygen (like normal, enter, enter, enter)
2) ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


mkdir .ssh && chmod 700 .ssh
touch .ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

ssh-add -K simba_rsa  /* this adds privat key to ssh agent, do this on the client machine, and append the corresponding public key, .pub, on the host machine's authorized_keys file */
