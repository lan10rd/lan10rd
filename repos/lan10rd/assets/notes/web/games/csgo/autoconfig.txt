// right click game in steam -> properties -> browse local files -> "find the cfg folder" -> new text document (autoexec.cfg)

On occasion, these settings won’t automatically load when you start the game. If this happens, all you need to do is to press” ~” to open your console. Then, type in “exec autoexec” to apply your settings.

Now your autoexec needs to launch every time you launch the game, so navigate to your Steam library again.

    Right click ‘Counter-Strike: Global Offensive’.
    Click ‘Properties’.
    Click ‘Set Launch Options’.
    Write ‘+exec autoexec.cfg’ and then click ‘OK’.
