In this instance, you could use the value 100vh (which is the height of the viewport) - (example)

body {
    height: 100vh;
}
Setting a min-height also works. (example)

body {
    min-height: 100vh;
}

html { height:100%; }


seems you need a parent with some height for any height percentage to work in a child. doesnt seem to be a thing with the width if the page is responsive
