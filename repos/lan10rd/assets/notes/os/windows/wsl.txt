wsl is windows subsystem for linux

wsl --install
wsl --set-version ubuntu wsl2

that might assume you have ubuntu, you can get it from microsoft store, might be a way to script it using wsl command instead tho.

ugh.
if you are on an early version of windows 10 that came with wsl1 you kinda gotta remove ubuntu using microsoft, then run (in elevated powershell)

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

then restart
then run the wsl-update.exe you can download from wsl install manual

then finally reinstall ubuntu
then reinstall docker desktop? might be able to keep it.

then set default version ubuntu wsl2

wsl --set-default-version ubuntu wsl2

--- erm, so i did uninstall docker not sure that was really required but if you uninstall docker, then

wsl.exe -l -version
wsl.exe --set-version ubuntu 2
wsl.exe --set-default-version 2
wsl.exe -l -v

then install docker
then check settings when docker launches

then open ubuntu, and type docker. voila!
