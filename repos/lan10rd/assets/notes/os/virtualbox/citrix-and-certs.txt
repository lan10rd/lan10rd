sudo cp entrust_g2_ca.cer /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/.
Magically, Citrix Receiver was happy again and I was able to connect.

Some points to note for next time
A colleague of mine had the same issue. He is running Debian.
His solution was to :

– delete the files in the Citrix Receiver certs directory :

1
/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/
– create a symlink in the directory from the certificates in

1
/etc/ssl/certs
