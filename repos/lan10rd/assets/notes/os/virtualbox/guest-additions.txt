Introduction
This explains how to share files and folders (directories) between host and guest. (Files are shared over a network, in other words, you access remote files. For virtual machines, the network between host and guest is virtual since they are on the same real machine. But the steps you take are similar to setting up file sharing over real networks.)

Required: Virtualbox Guest Additions
Before sharing folders, you must install Guest Additions. For instructions on how to do this, see Guest Additions.

Creating a shared folder
Create a folder on the Host computer (ubuntu) that you would like to share, for example ~/share

Boot the Guest operating system in VirtualBox.

Select Devices -> Shared Folders...

Choose the 'Add' button.
Select ~/share

Optionally select the 'Make permanent' option
Prepare the folder
Linux
With a shared folder named share, as above, the folder can be mounted as the directory ~/host with the command

sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$(id -g) share ~/host
Windows
On the Windows Guest, run

net use x: \\vboxsvr\share
